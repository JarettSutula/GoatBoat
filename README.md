# Mission Statement
To connect students with mentors to foster academic growth

# Hill Statements
1. In one minute, a student can find an effective and relatable tutor to study with.
2. A tutor should be able to connect with students at just the touch of a button.
3. A university can subscribe to the service on behalf of students, reducing labor cost.
4. Our team is committed to keeping up-to-date with changing educational circumstances even in a post-pandemic world.

# Branches
Branching on this project is inspired by the Gitflow method of branching. The main branch will be used for all major releases. Updates to main will come directly from the development branch as we do not plan on using release branches. New branches will be made off of dev for each feature that will be developed. Once a feature has been completed and merged into dev, tested, and approved, the feature branch will be deleted.

Before merging a branch to dev or main, developers must create a pull request. Each pull request must be reviewed by and meet the standards of team members other than the developer who authored the pull request.

# Project Summary
Goat Boat is a web application that dynamically pairs students with tutors. When signing up for the service, both students and tutors will be asked to share a few, select details about themselves. Their responses allow our team to find ideal pairs that we guarantee will lead to a better academic experience for our users.

Users can select classes from their school course catalog to look for help with or to help others with. This way, users can decide to be a Mentor, a Mentee, or a mix of both, all through a simple form. From there, users can choose from a list of candidates that would help them with what they are looking for.

# Prerequisites
GoatBoat requires specific python packages for our team to help foster our users' academic growth. For now, these can be installed manually by running this command in the root directory:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

# Installation
test for jenkins hook 2
