**Expectations:**
- All members should meet at least once a week virtually on Discord at Monday 5pm and/or Friday 5pm.
- All members should be on time and prepared for meetings.
- If a member cannot attend a meeting, they should let the group know in advance and prepare accordingly.
- All members must speak about their tasks/progress/issues - everyone should be heard.
- Members should reach out for help if they are stuck.
- Members should have extra time allotted for figuring out blockers in case they arise.
- Members should update the Project Board regularly.
- Members will assign themselves tasks fairly and only take 1 or 2 tasks at a time.
- Once a member assumes a task, they take ownership of it and keep it updated.
- Code reviews (and approvals) are strictly for the quality of the project and not a personal reflection.

**Branch Policy:**
- Master branch
- Development branch (pulled from latest Master)
- Feature branch (pulled from the latest Development branch)
- When a Feature is completed, members will push it to Dev, have it approved and pushed to Main, and then remove it.
- Any request from Dev has to be approved by the group before pushing to Master in order to keep it clean.

**Repercussions:**
- Members who constantly miss meetings or deadlines have to buy a pizza for the team.
- Members will be held accountable for not following their word.
- Members who are not communicating well will have to allocate extra time to meet with the team.
