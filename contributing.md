GoatBoat is an open source project! 

If you want to fix a bug, or have an idea of how to enhance the mentor matching process, please follow the instructions below:

Create an issue within the project. Doing so will allow us to see the issue, your solution and discuss it. 

If you have an idea of how to fix the issue, create a new branch off of dev, solve it, push it back up, and create a pull request. 
We require a review of at least half the GoatBoat team to have the issue be merged. Afterwards, if everything is agreed upon,
we'll merge your code into our dev branch.
